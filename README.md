# Black-Scholes-Option-Pricing-Model-Using-Python (Exe file creation)

The Black-Scholes Model is a mathematical formula used to price European options, based on factors like stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility, assuming no arbitrage and constant volatility. It provides a theoretical fair value for options and helps traders manage risk. here is this project, I have created the exe file from where one can use the Black Scholes Calculator

Parameters:
C = Call option price
P = Put option price

S = Current stock price

K = Strike price of the option

R = Risk-free interest rate

T = Time to expiration (in years)

Ïƒ / Vol = Volatility of the underlying asset
N(d) = Cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution
